# conan-ros2

This repository contains Conan recipes for ROS 2 packages and an example application that consumes these recipes.

## Requirements

We provide a Dockerfile that contains all the required dependencies.
To use the Dockerfile:

```sh
bash ./docker/build.sh
bash ./docker/run.sh
```

If you don't want to use the Dockerfile, the following dependencies will have to be installed on your machine:

 - cmake
 - colcon
 - conan
 - lark-parser
 - vcstool
 - wget

## Conan recipes

The `conan` directory contains 4 different Conan recipes.

Two of this recipes are the base for developing any other ROS 2 application in Conan.

 - `ros2-base` this is not a stand-alone recipe, but rather a [python requires](https://docs.conan.io/en/1.35/extending/python_requires.html), i.e. a "base class" that provides methods and utilities to be used in other ROS 2 recipes.
 - `ros2-virtualenvgen` this package provides a Conan virtual environment that can be used to expose env variables of all the ROS 2 recipes required by an application.

Then we have two additional recipes that serve as an example of how the base recipes can be used to build and package ROS 2 libraries.

 - `ros2-core` this recipe contains all the core ROS 2 libraries required by C++ applications.
 - `ros2-tf` this recipe contains the ROS 2 TF library C++ implementation.

Note that the content of these two recipes has been arbirarily chosen for the sake of this example.
It is both possible to agglomerate all ROS 2 dependencies within a single ROS 2 recipe as well as have a more fine-grained organization.
As an additional example, it is possible to have a recipe for ROS 2 build tools (e.g. ament), one for the ROS 2 core libraries, one for additional RMW implementations and a last one for desktop tools.
This split allows to cross-compile only those packages that will need to be used and deployed on the robot.

## Example Application

The `example-application` directory contains a basic C++ application that consumes the ROS 2 Conan recipes.

The ``example-application/conanfile.py` defines the list of Conan dependencies of the application.
